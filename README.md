# BPO-PL: A Data-Driven Blockchain Performance Optimization Framework for Parking Systems with High Transaction Traffic
A blockchain performance prediction model based on machine learning and a blockchain performance optimization framework has been submitted to IEEE Internet of Things Journal for review.
We are carefully organizing the project code and will gradually upload it to the repository as soon as possible.
## [Dataset: MMBPD](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loveffc/mmbpd-multimachine-blockchain-performance-dataset)
To make it easier to demonstrate the management of MMBPD, we have made it publicly available on Kaggle, please move to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loveffc/mmbpd-multimachine-blockchain-performance-dataset.
## Specific optimization steps
### 1.1 Train the blockchain performance prediction model
### 1.2 Use trained model to predict performance data
### 2.1 Perform performance scoring based on the predicted performance data
### 2.2 Dynamically adjust the blockchain configuration parameters according to the optimal parameters obtained from the performance scoring, to achieve blockchain performance optimization.
We are carefully organizing (e.g., adding comments and optimizing the structure of the code) this part of the code to enhance its readability and reproducibility, so we ask the esteemed editors and reviewers to wait a little while, and we sincerely appreciate your work and patience.

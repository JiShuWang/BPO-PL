# BPO-PL: A Data-Driven Blockchain Performance Optimization Framework for Multi-Organization Consortium Parking Lot
A blockchain performance prediction model based on machine learning and a blockchain performance optimization framework has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology for review.
We are carefully organizing the project code and will gradually upload it to the repository as soon as possible.

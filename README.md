# BPO-PL: A Data-Driven Blockchain Performance Optimization Framework for Multi-Organization Consortium Parking Lot
A blockchain performance prediction model based on machine learning and a blockchain performance optimization framework has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering for review.
We are carefully organizing the project code and will gradually upload it to the repository as soon as possible.
## [Dataset: MMBPD](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loveffc/mmbpd-multimachine-blockchain-performance-dataset)
To make it easier to demonstrate the management of MMBPD, we have made it publicly available on Kaggle, please move to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loveffc/mmbpd-multimachine-blockchain-performance-dataset.
## Specific optimization steps
### 1.1 Train the blockchain performance prediction model
### 1.2 Use trained model to reason about performance data
### 2.1 Perform performance scoring based on the inferenced performance data
### 2.2 Dynamically adjust the blockchain configuration parameters according to the optimal parameters obtained from the performance scoring, so as to achieve blockchain performance optimization.
